For the exhaustive numbered prototype list, including superseded and failed test builds, see [`docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md`](docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md).

## v1.0.4 - Chest Tracking and Windows 10 Startup Fix (updated 2026-10-08)

- Promote the Discord chest-tracking test to the production package while retaining version **1.0.4**. All 20 installed payloads and all four installer files are byte-for-byte identical to the tested ZIP.
- Fix opened wooden and red/coffin chests staying marked **Not collected** when the loaded scene collapses catalogue ancestors outside the accepted chest placement. Validate the complete inner owner path against that exact placement so the opened state reaches map and compass tracking.
- Preserve duplicate-placement, duplicate-owner, wrong-inner-path and save-epoch checks; loading an older save with an unopened chest can restore its uncollected state.
- On 2026-10-08 the author reported successful feedback from the Discord tester. The tester confirmed that opened red/common chests disappear and killed Ravens are tracked correctly. This is one player's field result, alongside the offline regressions below.
- Retain the 2026-10-06 Windows 10 startup fix and the earlier Realm Tear, Artefact and live compass-clearing fixes:

- Handle `SetAppCompatStringPointer` before either proxy's static CRT initialization without allocating, loading DLLs, or starting native workers. Replay the original compatibility arguments when graphics initialization begins.
- Fix the reproduced `ntdll` access violation from this early call. The supplied Windows 10 LTSC report has matching v1.0.1 DLL hashes and compatibility shims, but no crash stack; the reporting player confirmed successful startup on 2026-10-06.
- Add regressions for calls before CRT initialization and deferred compatibility argument replay in both native layers. Keep the supported EXE, companion hash, native instruction guards, and existing marker capacities.

## v1.0.3 - Real-Time In-World Compass Clearing & Full Artefact Authority Fix

- **Real-Time 3D In-World Compass Clearing**: Fixed player-tracked waypoint pins remaining active on the Compass HUD after collection/completion during live gameplay across all collectible families without requiring a save reload or reopening the map menu.
  - When collecting or completing an Artefact (`LuaHook_GiveLoot`), Realm Tear (`OnInteractFinish`), Chest (`OnOpened`), Jötnar Shrine (`UpdateJournal`), Treasure Dig (`UpdateQuest`), Lore Marker (`UpdateJournal`), or Lore/Treasure Scroll (`InteractComplete`), safely hides any active `"SIDE"` waypoint marker from `game.Compass` immediately.
  - Sends immediate `COMPLETIONIST_COLLECTIBLE_DIRTY_V1` hook dispatch to the UI VM, invoking `runtime:Poll()` to clean up tracked targets and synchronize direct observations in memory.
- **Full Artefact Direct Authority & Loaded Observation**: Fixed Artefact pins remaining visible on the 3D map menu after being collected.
  - Added native wallet resource tracking across all 45 Artefacts in `isDirectlyCollected()` (`collectible-location-map.lua`), handling multi-instance thresholds (e.g. `HornUShape`, `BroochRuby`, `HornHorse`, `ShipHook`) and category quest completion fallbacks (`Quest_Artifacts_*`).
  - Added `adapter == 'artefact'` support, owner fallback, and fast direct script lookup (`goartifactscript`) in `Loaded` reader (`collectible-loaded-reader.lua`).
  - Exported `GetState()` and `IsAcquired()` in `interact_loot_artifact.lua` to allow live loaded state extraction.

## v1.0.2 - Realm Tear Completion Authority Fix

- **Dual-Layer Realm Tear Completion Tracking**: Fixed Realm Tear markers not disappearing from the map after being completed and looted.
  - **Live Loaded Hierarchy & Adapter**: Updated `Loaded` module in `collectible-loaded-reader.lua` to recognize `adapter == 'rift'` (`hasOpened == true` / `GetState() == 4`), resolve rift interactive scripts (`gopocketrift_interact_loot`, `pocketrift_interact_loot`) through container parent hierarchies, and fall back to placement when owner matches are empty.
  - **Persistent Unloaded Authority**: Added `realm_tear` family handling in `isDirectlyCollected()` (`collectible-location-map.lua`) across all 21 Realm Tears mapping to their respective `RegionSummary_*_PocketRift_Parent` quests, silver rift labor quests, and Niflheim Trophy Tracker resources, ensuring completed tears stay hidden across map reopens, fast travels, and game restarts even when unloaded.
  - **Strict Read-Only Guarantee**: Maintained fail-closed observation architecture without progression writes or quest state modification.

## v1.0.1 - Startup Compatibility Fix (2026-10-04)

- Fix DXGI startup when optional Windows 11 export absent or export ordinals differ. Resolve system exports by name; optional exports no longer block graphics factories.
- Keep system graphics fallback when EXE or native DLL pair fails checks. Native patches stay disabled on unsupported builds; full mod still needs supported EXE.
- Installer checks EXE hash, all payload hashes, and boot JSON before backup or copy. Keep original backup and one art texpack entry on repeat install.
- Support pinned Steam 1.0.13 / GoW.exe 1.0.475.7534 only. Keep native hash and instruction guards. No change to Lua, map records, or art payloads from v1.0.0.
- Verified: 22 automated checks, Windows 10 export simulation, clean installer test, and two Windows 11 game launches with save loads. Save hash unchanged.
- Still needs player test: real Windows 10 launch and full map/compass controls. Reported PCs not yet retested; this release fixes reproduced startup defects, not proof every crash gone.

## v1.0.0 - Production Release

- **551 marker records across 16 custom collectible families**:
  - Odin's Ravens (53/54) with live native authority memory tracking (killed ravens never resurrect).
  - Nornir Chests (22) and Nornir puzzle sub-markers (66 seals, bells, mechanisms).
  - Legendary Chests (37 locations) with native read-only saved-state decoding.
  - Cipher Chests (14), Wooden Chests (99), Red / Coffin Chests (109).
  - Artefacts (45 across 7 sets), Jötnar Shrines (13), Lore Markers (43), Lore Scrolls (5).
  - Realm Tears (21), Treasure Maps (12), Treasure Dig Sites (12).
- **Strict No-Duplicate-Native-Marker Policy**: Preserves native handling for Valkyries, Valkyrie Queen, Mystic Gateways, and Shops to avoid duplicate pins.
- **Dedicated Compass HUD Art Pipeline**: 15 new `CompassIconClass` engine exports registered in `wad_r_perm.dcb` and `r_ui.wad`. Custom 2D HUD icons with live 3D bearing and distance readout in meters.
- **Map Controls**: On-screen `[Down Arrow]` show/hide toggle (persists across map reopens) and single-reticle `[Enter]` / `[E]` compass tracking with strict mutual exclusion.
- **Fog of War Support**: Custom markers render cleanly even in uncharted territory.
- **Read-Only Safety**: Fail-closed architecture without synthetic quest/save progression writes; save-epoch boundary resets prevent desyncs.
- **Universal 1-Click Installer**: Automated `Install.bat` / `Uninstall.bat` with multi-drive Steam/Epic auto-detection and stock backup support; Vortex/MO2 ready.

## v0.9.6.1-installer-fix

- Fixes an installer validation-order regression in v0.9.6.
- v0.9.6 checked for `PLAYER_HIDDEN_CENTER` before applying `$hiddenPlayerFocusRegex.Replace(...)`, so installation aborted even though the patch definition itself was valid.
- No gameplay, marker, filter, compass or lifecycle logic changes from v0.9.6.
- Retains `CursorSnap_Enabled=0`, `CursorSnap_Strength=0.0`, native-scale custom markers, stale-stock-compass clearing, hidden-Kratos opening centring, custom filters, Raven/Nornir lifecycle and `MaxIn=2.5`.
- Current test build: `Completionist-Map-v0.9.6.1-INSTALLER-FIX.zip`.

## v0.9.6-no-magnet-compass-fix

- v0.9.5.1 field result confirmed `PLAYER_HIDDEN_CENTER`, custom filters, Raven placement, Nornir parent/seal placement, distinct backing objects and Hide/Show Kratos are healthy.
- Diagnosed the v0.9.5 manual-hover experiment as invalid for selection: `MANUAL_HOVER_CURSOR` reported UI-local/root positions around `0,-40.222,0`, while custom map pins live around `x=3.x`, `z=0.x`.
- Because no `MANUAL_HOVER active=true`, `NORNIR_CHEST_COMPASS`, `NORNIR_COMPASS` or `CUSTOM_COMPASS` event fired, the observed `BOAT DOCK - The Mason's Channel` / ~683 m HUD destination was a stock DockPoint selection, not the Completionist target.
- Restores the field-proven v0.9.4 `UI.SetIsClickable()` + `MapCollisionChangeHandler` custom marker selection path.
- Disables map-camera magnetic attraction completely for the test build: `CursorSnap_Enabled=0`, `CursorSnap_Strength=0.0`.
- Restores custom map visuals to native backing scale `1.0`.
- Clears any currently tracked stock compass marker before enabling Raven/Nornir custom tracking, avoiding stale stock DockPoint HUD destinations.
- Retains the hidden-Kratos opening-centre fix and deep zoom `MaxIn=2.5`.
- Notes that the original Completionist icon source set is already present on `dev`; icon injection remains a separate next milestone after interaction/compass routing is stable.
- Initial field install did not complete because `PLAYER_HIDDEN_CENTER` was validated before its replacement ran. Superseded for testing by v0.9.6.1.

## v0.9.5.1-installer-fix

- Fixes another installer validation-order regression: v0.9.5 checked for `PLAYER_HIDDEN_CENTER` before applying the hidden-player-focus replacement.
- Field result: installation succeeds and hidden Kratos correctly keeps the map centred on the player when reopening (`PLAYER_HIDDEN_CENTER`).
- Field result also confirms filters, Raven and Nornir placement remain healthy.
- Field result rejects the manual-hover coordinate approach: the queried `MapCursor` world positions are not map-space positions, so the custom marker selection path never activates.

## v0.9.5-no-magnet-hover

- Field result from v0.9.4 confirmed Raven/Nornir target separation is fixed: Raven stayed at its immutable map coordinates while a Nornir chest was the active compass target.
- Field result also confirmed custom filters, Raven/Nornir positions, Hide/Show Kratos, seal/chest compass tracking and Nornir lifecycle remain healthy.
- Fixes hidden-Kratos reopening. Hiding `MapIconPlayer` no longer forces stock `SubmenuEnter()` to centre on `CALDERA_MAP_POSITION`; the hidden transformed player GO remains the opening camera focus.
- Restores synthetic marker visuals from temporary scale `0.28` to native backing scale `1.0`.
- Removes `UI.SetIsClickable()` from synthetic Completionist pins and attempts a manual `0.018` map-unit nearest-target hover path.
- **Field result:** the manual-hover approach cannot use `MapCursor:GetWorldPosition()` as map-space coordinates; no custom hover/compass selection event is produced. A nearby stock DockPoint can therefore be selected instead.
- Superseded by v0.9.6, which returns to native clickable collision but disables the map-camera snap magnet itself.

## v0.9.4-raven-snap-fix

- Field result from v0.9.3.1 confirmed the full map-side stack was healthy again: filters, Raven/Nornir pins, custom compass, Kratos toggle and real Nornir chest-open removal all worked.
- Fixes Raven/Nornir target interference. Raven map placement no longer reads the single shared active compass target's `mapX/mapZ`; it uses immutable Raven map coordinates instead.
- Adds `RAVEN_PIN_INDEPENDENT` diagnostic to prove Raven stays at its own map coordinate while a Nornir chest/seal is tracked.
- Replaces ineffective adaptive root scaling (`cursorScale=1`, `customIconScale=1` in field logs) with fixed synthetic root scale `0.28`.
- Reduces Nornir child selection latch from `120` to `12` frames.
- Tightens close-zoom snap further:
  - `CursorScale_Min: 0.12 -> 0.05`
  - `CursorSnap_Strength: 0.55 -> 0.18`
- Retains deep zoom `MaxIn=2.5`, distinct backing IDs, custom filters, seal Add-to-Compass and Hide/Show Kratos.
- Field result: Raven/Nornir target interference was fixed, but hidden Kratos caused fallback map centring and synthetic pins remained too magnetic at deep zoom. Scale `0.28` also made them visibly smaller than native markers.

## v0.9.3.1-map-load-hotfix

- Field result from v0.9.3 showed **no map-side Completionist startup at all**: `MAP_SCRIPT_LOADED`, `FILTER_MAPPING`, custom marker creation and `PLAYER_MARKER_TOGGLE` were all absent.
- Rebuilds from the field-proven compile-good v0.9.2 map patch instead of stacking more structural edits onto v0.9.3.
- Fixes the v0.9.2 adaptive-scale nil helper with the safe Lua pattern already used elsewhere: forward-declare `CompletionistMapV0931_ApplyZoomAdaptiveIconScale`, then assign its implementation later.
- Leaves the v0.9.2 Raven/Nornir marker loops structurally unchanged.
- Retains distinct discovered DockPoint backing IDs for Raven, Nornir parent and Nornir puzzle pins.
- Keeps deep map zoom at `MaxIn=2.5`.
- Reduces close-zoom snapping:
  - `CursorScale_Min: 0.50 -> 0.12`
  - `CursorSnap_Strength: 2.4 -> 0.55`
- Retains custom filters, seal Add-to-Compass and Hide/Show Kratos.
- Field result: successful recovery. `ALIAS_CHECK` reported distinct GameObjects, but Raven still moved to a Nornir target because its reinforcement used the shared compass-target coordinates. Snapping also remained too aggressive.

## v0.9.3-nornir-snap-fix

- Intended to fix the v0.9.2 marker-creation regression and tighten snapping.
- **Field regression:** map-side Completionist code did not initialise at all. The log contained gameplay/HUD instrumentation but no `MAP_SCRIPT_LOADED`, `FILTER_MAPPING`, custom markers or Kratos toggle.
- Superseded by v0.9.3.1, which is rebuilt from v0.9.2 rather than modifying the broken v0.9.3 map structure.

## v0.9.2-distinct-backings-snap

- Introduced a pool of distinct discovered Midgard DockPoint backing IDs rather than reusing one marker ID for all synthetic pins.
- Added `BACKING_POOL`, `BACKING_ASSIGN` and `ALIAS_CHECK` diagnostics.
- Attempted zoom-adaptive synthetic marker scaling.
- Field result: Raven remained visible, but Nornir parent/children disappeared because the scale helper resolved as a nil global during creation.

## v0.9.1-seal-compass-zoom-player

- Confirmed Nornir seal Add-to-Compass: `NORNIR_PROMPT -> NORNIR_COMPASS -> HUD_NORNIR_TRACK`.
- Gives puzzle children collision priority over their parent chest and keeps a short selection latch.
- Extends map zoom to `MaxIn=2.5`.
- Adds session-local Hide/Show Kratos map-marker toggle while preserving stock Go-to-Journal behaviour.

## v0.9.0.1-installer-fix

- Fixes v0.9.0 installer validation ordering. The milestone logic was valid, but the installer checked for the injected native-hover path before applying that injection.

## v0.9.0-nornir-lifecycle-native-hover

- Removes custom `Camera.PointAt()` marker hover recentering so custom hover preserves zoom.
- Uses the stock selected-cursor animation path.
- Reveals remaining Nornir puzzle siblings after the locked chest is attempted/restored as locked.
- Observes `interact_chest_standard.lua::OnOpened()` as the authoritative Runic chest-open event.
- Clears/removes the Nornir parent only after the real loot chest is opened.

## v0.8.7-nornir-compass-fix

- Fixes Lua lexical scope for `CompletionistMap...GetNornirRegistry` by forward-declaring the local helper before `IsTargetCollected()` captures it.

## v0.8.6-map-filter-fix

- Fixes the premature `end` in the v0.8.5 `MapOn:Update()` injection.
- Restores map-side Completionist loading, Raven/Nornir pins and custom filter mapping.
- Correctly omits persisted broken Breakable seals.

## v0.8.5-nornir-hierarchy-filters

- Introduces top-level Nornir chest parents versus child puzzle actors.
- Adds Completionist-specific logical filters into the existing bottom-left filter cycle.
- Field result: map-side injection failed because `MapOn:Update()` was closed early.

## v0.8.4-nornir-compass-zoom

- Removes a MainHUD call to a map-only Nornir registry helper.
- Tracks selected Nornir targets directly by copied world XYZ.
- Adds extended map zoom (`MaxIn 6 -> 3.5`).

## v0.8.3-nornir-registry-fix

- Fixes map/gameplay context isolation by adding a cross-context bridge and a verified-coordinate fallback for the known Breakable chest.
- Makes synthetic Nornir map pins independent of shared `_G` state for the tested chest.

## v0.8.2-nornir-map-hud

- First visible synthetic Nornir map/HUD prototype.
- Field result exposed that gameplay and map scripts did not share the assumed plain `_G` registry.

## v0.8.1-nornir-seal-state

- Adds exact `runeIndex` and individual rune visual-state diagnostics.
- Establishes persisted Breakable seal suppression semantics.

## v0.8.0-nornir-position-diagnostic

- Resolves `sealBreakable01..03` GameObjects to exact world XYZ for a real Breakable Nornir chest.

## v0.7.8-raven-lifecycle

- Raven milestone: map target led to a real remaining Raven.
- Killing the Raven cleared the custom HUD target and suppressed its later map marker.

## v0.7.x custom-HUD research

- Iterated away from unsafe synthetic native compass markers.
- Proved a HUD-native visual can be repositioned along the compass according to an arbitrary stored world XYZ bearing.
- See `docs/VERSION_HISTORY.md` for v0.7 through v0.7.7 individually.

## v0.6-api-transform-prototype

- Confirmed native marker records expose world-space `Coordinates`.
- Solved Midgard world-to-map transform:
  - `mapX = 0.004 * worldZ + 0.0625431`
  - `mapZ = -0.004 * worldX + 0.6101961`
- Maximum observed residual was approximately `1.2e-7` map units.

## v0.5.1-raven-registry-diagnostic

- Validates/deploys a pinned Raven gameplay-script reference when local source is missing.
- Confirms three Veithurgard Raven objects: two killed and one alive, matching the region summary.
- Captures exact remaining Raven world XYZ.

## v0.4-diagnostic

- Correlates realm/region completion summaries with hidden marker records.
- Rejects the native hidden-marker table as the direct collectible source.

## v0.3.1-diagnostic

- Uses incomplete Midgard against 100%-complete Alfheim as control.
- Proves `kUndiscovered` is dominated by infrastructure and is not a collectible state.

## v0.2-diagnostic

- Proves hidden marker records are exposed to Lua without rendering them.

## v0.1-test

- First hidden-marker rendering experiment.
- Opening the map crashed; direct rendering of arbitrary undiscovered native records was abandoned.
